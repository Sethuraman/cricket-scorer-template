This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This web app has been designed to run on a mobile phone size screen only. 

It has the following additional notable installations:

 - [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) - For the UI
 - [redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-starter-kit) - To remove the boiler plate around redux - actions and reducers.
